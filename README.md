## Schwurbler Extension
### A word frequency util in a chrome extension that marks the conspiracy words in red (5 words so far)

Wordy lists all words on the current web page by usage frequency.

###Installation

Drag [wordy-extension.crx](https://github.com/angus-c/wordy-extension/blob/master/wordy-extension.crx) to your chrome extensions page.
I'll probably add it to the store at some point.

###Usage

By default wordy lists every 5+ letter word on the page in frequency order
